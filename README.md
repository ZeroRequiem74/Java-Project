# Overview

This project was my first attempt at Java. It is a simple game where the user tries to guess a number in a certain amount of guesses and the program will tell the user higher or lower after each guess to help the user guess the number. I added a twist that allows the user to enter in how many guesses they get as well as the max number that the random number can be.

My purpose in writing this was to get familiar with the Java language and I believed a game would be fun.

# Development Environment

While making this I mainly used websites with some Java tutorials on Youtube.

# Useful Websites

- [we3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java/)
- [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/pages/learn-java-with-codecademy-pro?utm_id=t_kwd-79646267533976:loc-4094:ag_1274334598702285:cp_370314508:n_o:d_c&msclkid=424f6d83724014b4e4a60a716153e8b1&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=US%20-%20Exact&utm_term=java%20tutorial&utm_content=java)

# Future Work

- I want to make this game have funny commentary based off the amount the guess is off to make it more fun.
- I want to make it so that the user has the choice to repeat the game after it ends.
